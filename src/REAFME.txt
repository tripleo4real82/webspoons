The technologies used for this project is Springbooth and H2db

Springbooth was used because it is robust and very efficient with wide support globally.
It is also light weight and runs on embedded server

H2db is an inmemory database and it is very fast and efficient

An inmemory database was used because the data stored in it is meant to be volatile.

This project however is not suitable for production as it is not secured with authentication and authorization modules
